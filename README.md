# clickforcharity
**An Open Source Peer-To-Peer Charity System.**

Clickforcharity is a way for people to interact directly as well as contribute directly to charitable projects. While it is open source and as such can be used for any purpose, it is designed specifically for peer-to-peer personal interactions and is likely not useful for nor suited to fundraising by an organization.

The main site is [clickforcharity.net](https://clickforcharity.net/) which is intended as a working example of the system.
